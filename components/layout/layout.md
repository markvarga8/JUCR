## Layout main parts:

- index.tsx: This is where the layout comes together with the desktop, navigation and mobile components.
- DesktopMenu.tsx: This component is responsible for the desktop view.
- MobileMenu.tsx: This component is responsible for the mobile/tablet view.
- NavMenu.tsx: This component is responsible for the top navigation.
- MenuItem.tsx: This component is integrated into the desktop/mobile component and can therefore be managed separately.
